So what is astronomy you may ask, Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.

Now Lets talk 𝒫𝓁𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓉𝓈, So what are planets exactly 

A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
There 8 known planets in the solar system and theyre known as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
